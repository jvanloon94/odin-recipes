      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><em>One day ahead:</em>Mix baking soda into cold water in a large bowl.<br>Place chickpeas in this solution.<br>Store in fridge overnight.<br>Change water after 12 hours of soaking.</li>
        <li>Remove chickpeas from fridge. Strain and rinse. Place in food processor.</li>
        <li>Toast whole cumin, coriander, and black peppercorns in a saute pan over medium low heat until deeply aromatic and darker in color. Place whole spices into food processor with chickpeas. Place cardamom, cayenne pepper, chopped parsley, and garlic in food processor.</li>
        <li>Process only until coarse and moldable. Do not over-process or the patties will fail to hold shape. </li>
        <li>Remove mixture from food processor. Place into a covered bowl. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat oil over medium heat in a thick-bottomed skillet or dutch oven. While oil is heating, form processed mixture into small patties and set aside on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Prepare a second baking sheet lined with paper towel near your fry station.</li>
        <li>Once the oil has reached 370 degrees place several small patties into the oil using a slotted metal spoon. Once the patties are a light golden brown on one side, flip them. Once the second side is identical to the first, they are ready to be removed from the oil and set aside on your paper towel lined baking sheet to cool.</li>
        <li>After all of your falafel are removed and cooling, <strong>turn off all heating elements</strong> enjoy the first falafel you removed from the oil as soon as possible.</li>
